# DX11 Dear ImGui Base Example - Marauders


This source was originally created by me [NightFyre] as a method to teach somebody who had 0 experience with Unreal Engine. He went and published the open source code. Once I noticed this I went ahead and forked the repository and submitted a PR with an updated readme. 

He ended up deleting the repository , shocker , but the damage has been done. 

A lot of this source has been butchered compared to the methods I taught. Ultimately I would rather not have this published but being that it already has been ... I will do my part and update this filth to my standards and provide the community with a full featured Marauders Cheat.  

The open source framework itself is available to anybody via [Dx9](https://github.com/NightFyre/DX9-ImGui-Internal-Hook) & [Dx11](https://github.com/NightFyre/DX11-ImGui-Internal-Hook) respectively.  

Framework Components include the following:
- Console
- D3DWindow
- Game
- Hooking
- Menu
